					<h2>There are a few storeis to tell.</h2>
				</section>
                <section><h2>The story of Drupal</h2></section>
				<section>
					<h2>Once upon a time,</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>a little boy called Dries lived in Belgium.</h2>
					<img src="./images/young-dries.jpg" alt="Dries with baby Drupal." />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>While at uni Dries had a little baby called Drupal.</h2>
					<img src="./images/dries-baby.png" alt="Dries with baby Drupal." />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal started to grow.</h2>
					<img src="./images/school-kid.png" alt="Druplicon's first day at school" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Like many kids Drupal started doing odd jobs.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>While at high school Drupal got a part time job.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eventually Drupal made it to uni.</h2>
					<img src="./images/Home_HMS.png" alt="HMS's Drupal powered homepag" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>After graduating Drupal got a job. It Sold Whiskey</h2>
					<img src="./images/jds.png" alt="Jack Daniels Drupal powered homepage" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>One day a big corporation rang and offered Drupal a job.</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Drupal accepted.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>On the first day Drupal turned up for work,</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>and it was clear Drupal didn't quite fit in.</h2>
					<img src="./images/hipster.png" alt="Hipster Druplicon" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal was used to doing everything on production.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>One day the boss called and told Drupal to go buy some new tools.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal started searching for new tools.</h2>
					<img src="./images/ebay.png" alt="Ebay enterprise tools search results" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The next day Drupal's new tools arrived.</h2>
					<img src="./images/toolbox.jpg" alt="Toolbox" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal's boss was impressed.</h2>
					<img src="./images/boss.jpg" alt="Woman giving thumbs up" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>And they all deployed happily ever after.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What was in the toolbox that made Drupal's boss so happy?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Features</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>hook_update_N</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deploy Tools</h2>
				</section>

					<h2>drush</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>git</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>Custom Entities</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>These tools allowed Drupal to do things very differently.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>When Drupal was younger databases were swapped</h2>
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Downtime was mandatory</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>There was no easy to read log of all changes.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal had difficulty looking at a single change on it's own.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Configureation and code changes couldn't be bundled together.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deployment was an all or nothing event.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deployments couldn't really be tested.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Different permissions and configuration per environment weren't possible.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>This all made Drupal very sad.</h2>
					<img src="./images/druplicon_sad.png" class="trans-images" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal decided to change how things were done.</h2>
					<img src="./images/chart_wftools_flow.png" alt="Code goes up, Content goes up." class="trans-images" />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal discovered that arbitrary sets of changes could be bundled together in code (even database based configuration changes).</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2> this eleiminated the need for dtabase swaps.</h2>
				</section>
                <section><h2>Napkins where made obsolete</h2>
                <img src="./images/napkin.jpg" />
                </section>
                <section><h2>Developers did not even have to use the risk making a mistake in prodction </h2>
				<img src="images/No_touching.png" />
                    </section>
				<section>
					<h2>Now Drupal can group code changes with current content changes.</h2>

 					<h2>Drupal's cousin's name is "featureFooBar123".</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal makes sure featureFooBar123 is safe on an epic journey.</h2>
					<img src="./images/chart_wftools_job.png" alt="featureFooBar123's Epic Journey" class="trans-images"/>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>featureFooBar123 started off as nothing more than a twinkle in somebody's eye.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>First, Drupal spins up a new dedicated drupal sandbox called featureFooBar123.dev.site.com.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Next, Drupal creates a featureFooBar123 git branch and checks it out on the sandbox.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Drupal then creates a featureFooBar123 deployment plan to track the content changes.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Drupal makes changes to content or code (or both) on the sandbox.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Now featureFooBar123 is big enough to move to the integration environment.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Drupal merges the featureFooBar123 git branch into the integration git branch and pushes it to the integration server.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Then Drupal triggers the featureFooBar123 deployment plan to be pushed to the integration server.</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Drupal sits back and looks at the changes merged into the integration server...</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>...and decides featureFooBar123 is ready to move to the staging environment.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>From there, the same merge/approval happens on staging before being pushed to production.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>All of the jobs' statuses are tracked by Drupal.</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drupal can tell at a glance which jobs are in which environments, and which are ready for approval...</h2>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>…all from a central management console.</h2>
					<img src="./images/chart_wftools_multi.png" alt="Jobs and Environments" class="trans-images"/>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>This management console is the heart of WF Tools.</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>The rolling releases model is made possible</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>Could allows people to go from sningle idea to prod in an afternoon.</h2>
				</section>
